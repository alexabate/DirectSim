This readme describes the contents of the SEDs/ subdirectory 
of DirectSim.


SED libraries -------------------------------------------

SED "libraries" are defined in files ending in .list
They are simply a list of filenames of text files within
the SEDs subdirectory.


"Libraries" as of 8th May 2014 are:

* CWWK.list

This is the _traditional_ photo-z template set, four templates
from Coleman, Wu and Weedman 1980: Ell (elliptical), 
Sbc (spiral), Scd (spiral), Im (irregular) and two templates
from Kinney et al 1996: SB3 (starburst) and SB2 (starburst)


* CWWKSB.list

As CWWK.list but with two bluer templates added, synthetic spectra
generated from a stellar populations code. See Coe et al 2006.
This is the standard template library BPZ comes with 


* LSST.list

All 791 templates that were used in the LSST simulations for
Data Challenge 3b, performance test 1.2. These are generated
from Bruzual et Charlot model


* LSSTshort.list

The closest LSST.list templates to the templates in CWWKSB.list.


SED files -------------------------------------------------

Simple text files with two columns: (1) wavelength in meters
(2) flux in wavelength units, f_\nu, arbritrarily normalized
